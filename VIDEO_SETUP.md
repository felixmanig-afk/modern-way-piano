# ðŸŽ¥ Video Setup for Production

## Current Status
Your code is now successfully pushed to GitHub! However, the video files are too large for GitHub (over 100MB), so they're excluded from the repository.

## Video Solutions for Production

### Option 1: Upload Videos to Vercel (Recommended)
1. **After deploying to Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Storage" or "Assets"
   - Upload `site_snippets-1.mp4` directly to Vercel
   - Get the public URL and update your code

### Option 2: Use a CDN Service
1. **Cloudinary** (Free tier available):
   - Upload your video to cloudinary.com
   - Get the optimized URL
   - Update the video source in your code

2. **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage**:
   - Upload video files
   - Make them publicly accessible
   - Update video URLs in your code

### Option 3: Use Poster Image Only (Temporary)
Your website works perfectly with just the poster image. The video is a nice-to-have enhancement.

## Quick Fix: Use Poster Image
If you want to deploy immediately, I can update your code to use only the poster image (which looks great):

```bash
# This will make your site work immediately
git add .
git commit -m "Use poster image instead of video for immediate deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy to Vercel first** (your code is ready)
2. **Add videos later** using one of the methods above
3. **Your site will work perfectly** with or without videos

The poster image provides a beautiful, professional look that works great for your piano lesson website!
