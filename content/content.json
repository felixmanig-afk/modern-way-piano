Kloe is incredibly patient, knowledgeable, and is able to tailor each lesson to my pace and goals. These lessons are always well-structured and engaging, combining sheet music with scales, arpeggios and chords - her teaching method makes complex techniques more understandable.

    { "name": "Felix", "quote": "Kloe is an incredible piano teacher who helped me bring my skills to a whole new level over the past 6 months! Her expertise in piano is evident from the very first lesson, and she has an amazing ability to break down complex techniques in a way that's easy to understand. I felt like I was plateauing on my skill level, and Kloe knew exactly how to help me move forward with confidence. What I appreciate most is her kind and encouraging approach. She's always patient, never intimidating, and makes you feel comfortable no matter where you're starting from. Each lesson is not only productive but also fun—she brings so much positive energy and creativity that learning feels like an exciting journey, not a chore. Kloe truly made the process enjoyable and rewarding, and I can't recommend her enough for anyone looking to improve their piano skills!" }
